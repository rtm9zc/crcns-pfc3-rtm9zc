The main data file was extracted into a directory called pfc3, ending with a filepath like data/pfc3/data/<datafile.mat> for the primary data.

Additionally, the file SummaryDatabase.xlsx contains a mapping between the individual files for neuronal activity to the classes of trial (pre/post/during training & activity trained for). For conviencence, this file was split into a separate csv file for each sheet in the original xlsx file, ending up with 5 separate files, each of which groups a particular trial class. These summary documents are saved in the data/pfc3 directory.
