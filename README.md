I will be analyzing data from the CRCNS's pfc-3 dataset of neuronal activity in the pre-frontal cortex of macaque monkeys before and after being trained on a visual memory task. I hope to see if there is any pattern in the neuronal activity during the training process, with a goal being to see if there is any sort of trend for neuronal firing rates that could indicate a subject having learned a particular task/having been sufficently trained.

More to come soon!
